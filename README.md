# UFOs

## Overview of analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This criteria includes the date,the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results 
To perform a search on the webpage, the user would scroll about half way down the screen until they see this part of the screen.

On the left side, under 'Filter Search', this is where the user can enter at least one of the following criteria followed to narrow down their search.

## Summary 
- At least one drawback of the webpage is that if you search with multiple criteria, the criteria must be correct for results to populate.
- Two recommendations for futher development would be that the 'Filter Search' would not be case sensitive, and a 'No Results Found' message could populate on the screen instead of the screen going blank.
